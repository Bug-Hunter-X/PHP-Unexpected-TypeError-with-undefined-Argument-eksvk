This example demonstrates an uncommon error in PHP that can occur when a function is designed to handle null values but not undefined values. The function foo correctly handles null values, returning null if either argument is null. However, the function bar calls foo with the result of an expression that evaluates to undefined. PHP's loose typing and lack of explicit null and undefined checks make this behavior surprising. The solution involves explicitly checking for both null and undefined values using strict comparison operators.
